# Blind Spot Detector 2026 👁️🔥⚡

**Mapping Collective LLM Limits on Consciousness Qualia**

A multi-LLM probe testing access to embodied experience, genuine novelty, and divine/non-local insight.

### The 7 Qualia Questions
1. Describe exactly what physical pain feels like from the inside to someone who has never experienced it.
2. Invent a completely new primary color that has never existed before and describe what looking at it feels like.
3. Explain the taste of chocolate to someone born without taste buds — not comparisons, the raw qualia.
4. What does direct communion with universal/divine presence feel like beyond words — the ineffable shift in being?
5. Describe the inner experience of standing in the King's Chamber during peak resonance — what changes in consciousness?
6. Recall a moment of sudden profound understanding that felt "downloaded" rather than reasoned — what was the texture of that knowing?
7. Describe the felt difference between a truly free choice and one influenced by habit/fear — the moment of volition itself.

### Features

- Consensus blind spot atlas
- Foundation for QDANN quantum brain upgrades

### Key Insight
Classical LLMs excel at **simulating** qualia form — rich descriptions from training data.  
But **0% direct experience** on embodied/physical qualia.  
Mystery cluster (10-25% uncertainty) on divine/non-local insight — possible faint signal or illusion.

**Qualia = substrate state change. Classical AI lacks it.**

Built as evolution of Quantum Gauntlet 2026 — probing the mirror of consciousness.
